# SolarEdge Monitoring API v2 for Home Assistant

A Home Assistant custom integration that reads a SolarEdge site through the
SolarEdge Monitoring API **v2** (`https://monitoringapi.solaredge.com/v2`).
SolarEdge has announced that the V1 API (the `?api_key=` query-string API that
the Home Assistant core `solaredge` integration uses) stops responding on
**November 3, 2026**. V1 site API keys do not carry over: V2 issues new
credentials, and homeowners authorize through OAuth 2.0.

[SolarEdge](https://www.solaredge.com) makes inverters, power optimizers,
batteries, and meters for residential and commercial solar systems. Its cloud
monitoring platform collects telemetry from each site; this integration reads
that platform.

Design notes, protocol facts, and operational detail live under
[docs/](docs/README.md).

## What it provides

One config entry per site. Each entry creates a site device and, when
per-device telemetry is on, one device per inverter, meter, and battery in the
site inventory.

| Sensor | Device | Source (V2 endpoint) | Enabled by default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current power (W) | Site | `GET /sites/{id}/power`, latest 15-minute bucket | Yes |
| Production today, Consumption today | Site | `GET /sites/{id}/overview` | Yes |
| Exported to grid today, Imported from grid today | Site | `GET /sites/{id}/overview` | Yes |
| Self-consumed, Charged to storage, Consumed from storage today | Site | `GET /sites/{id}/overview` | No |
| Lifetime production | Site | `GET /sites/{id}/energy`, yearly buckets since installation | Yes |
| Peak power, Last update from site, Open alerts | Site (diagnostic) | `GET /sites/{id}`, `GET /sites/{id}/alerts` | Yes |
| AC power (hourly average), Energy today | Inverter | `GET /sites/{id}/inverters/telemetry` | Yes |
| AC voltage, AC current, Grid frequency | Inverter | same | No |
| Production, consumption, import, export power | Meter | `GET /sites/{id}/meters/telemetry` | Yes |
| Production, consumption, import, export today | Meter | same | No |
| Charge power, Discharge power, State of energy, Remaining energy | Battery | `GET /sites/{id}/storage/telemetry` | Yes |
| Charged today, Discharged today | Battery | same | No |

The "today" sensors reset at midnight site time and use the `total_increasing`
state class, so they work in the Energy dashboard.

## Use cases

- Keep solar production and grid import/export in the Energy dashboard after
  the V1 API is switched off.
- Get a notification when SolarEdge opens an alert on an inverter, meter, or
  battery (see the blueprint below).
- Watch battery state of energy alongside other home automations.

## Supported and unsupported devices

Supported: any SolarEdge site visible in the SolarEdge monitoring platform,
with the inverters, meters, and batteries that its inventory reports.

Not supported: per-optimizer (panel-level) data. The V2 Monitoring API lists
optimizers in the inventory but exposes no optimizer telemetry. Panel-level
data remains available only through the monitoring web portal, which the
[solaredgeoptimizers](https://github.com/AndrewTapp/solaredgeoptimizers)
custom integration reads; that integration does not use the V1 API and is not
affected by the V1 shutdown. Live power flow, per-destination energy, Weather
Guard, and backup reserve are Advanced Monitoring endpoints limited to the
Business Pro and Enterprise tiers and are not implemented.

## Prerequisites

- Home Assistant 2026.9.0 or newer.
- A SolarEdge developer account at <https://developer.solaredge.com>. The Free
  tier (2,000 credits a month) is enough for one site with the default
  options.
- One of:
  - **Site Access (homeowners).** A Site Access application with the
    `SITE_DATA` and `DEVICE_DATA` scopes and the Redirect URI
    `https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth`. Sign in to the developer
    console with your mySolarEdge account. SolarEdge's
    [Homeowner and Self-Access Guide](https://api-docs.solaredge.com/docs/developer-platform/df8kx5j4z9vi0-homeowner-and-self-access-guide)
    shows each screen.
  - **Fleet Access (installers and fleet owners).** A Fleet Access
    application's App API Key.

## Installation

1. In HACS, add this repository as a custom repository of type Integration,
   then download **SolarEdge Monitoring API v2**.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. For Site Access only: go to **Settings > Devices & services > three-dot
   menu > Application credentials**, add credentials for **SolarEdge
   Monitoring API v2**, and enter the Client ID and Client Secret of your
   Site Access application.
4. Go to **Settings > Devices & services > Add integration** and choose
   **SolarEdge Monitoring API v2**.

## Configuration parameters

Asked during setup:

| Parameter | Access type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Access type | both | Site Access (OAuth) or Fleet Access (App API Key). |
| Site ID | Site Access | The numeric site ID you approved on the consent screen. Home Assistant's OAuth callback does not pass SolarEdge's `site_id` parameter through, so it is asked for after sign-in and checked with `GET /sites/{id}`. |
| App API Key | Fleet Access | Sent in the `X-API-Key` header. The flow lists every site the key can read. |
| Site | Fleet Access | Chosen from that list when there is more than one. |

Options (**Configure** on the entry):

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Update interval | 60 minutes (15 to 360) | How often production, consumption, and power are read. |
| Per-device telemetry | Off | Adds inverter, meter, and battery sensors at up to three extra credits per update. Requires the `DEVICE_DATA` scope for Site Access. |

## How data is updated

Every API call costs one credit. The integration polls on three cadences:

- Every update interval: `overview` and `power` (2 credits), plus one
  telemetry call per device family present when per-device telemetry is on.
- Every 6 hours: site metadata, lifetime energy, and open alerts (3 credits).
- Every 12 hours: the device inventory (1 credit).

With the defaults, one site uses about 1,860 credits in a 30-day month. The
arithmetic and other combinations are in
[docs/operations.md](docs/operations.md). The API's finest resolution is 15
minutes, so an interval shorter than that returns the same bucket.

## Automation example

The blueprint
[`solaredge_open_alert_notify.yaml`](blueprints/automation/solaredge_open_alert_notify.yaml)
sends a notification when the Open alerts sensor rises above zero.

## Known limitations

- The V1 API is not used at all; existing core `solaredge` entities are not
  migrated. Statistics from the core integration stay under their old entity
  IDs.
- No optimizer (panel-level) data, as described above.
- V2 dropped several V1 inverter and battery fields (inverter temperature,
  inverter mode, per-phase data, battery internal temperature, battery
  state code); they cannot be offered.
- Site current power is the average of the latest 15-minute bucket, not an
  instantaneous reading. Inverter, meter, and battery power are hourly
  averages, because the API allows at most 12 hours of 15-minute data and the
  same call must cover the whole day for the "today" totals.
- Right after midnight site time the day's first bucket may not exist yet, so
  device values read unknown until it does.
- SolarEdge Site Access grants last at most 24 months; the integration
  requests the maximum. Refresh tokens expire after 30 days without use, so an
  instance that is off for longer than that needs reauthentication.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Add application credentials first" when choosing Site Access | No Client ID and Secret stored | Add them under Application credentials (Installation step 3). |
| Redirect error after approving | The application's Redirect URI does not match | Set it to `https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth` in the developer console. |
| "These credentials cannot read this site" | Wrong Site ID, or the grant covers another site | Enter the Site ID shown on the consent screen, or approve the correct site. |
| Repair issue "monthly API credits used up" | The developer account's credits are spent | Raise the interval or turn off per-device telemetry; updates resume at the next billing cycle. |
| Repair issue "device telemetry not permitted" | The grant lacks `DEVICE_DATA` | Reconfigure and approve both scopes, or turn telemetry off. |
| Entities unavailable and a reauthentication prompt | Token or key rejected (HTTP 401) | Follow the prompt; Site Access reruns sign-in, Fleet Access asks for a new key. |

Diagnostics (**three-dot menu > Download diagnostics**) include the last parsed
data with the key and tokens redacted.

## Removal

1. **Settings > Devices & services > SolarEdge Monitoring API v2 > three-dot
   menu > Delete** for each site.
2. For Site Access, optionally remove the application credential and revoke
   the grant: in the SolarEdge developer console, delete or rotate the Site
   Access application, or revoke the token with
   `POST https://monitoringapi.solaredge.com/v2/oauth2/revoke-token`.
3. Remove the repository from HACS and restart Home Assistant.

## Quality scale

The integration targets the Platinum tier; the rule-by-rule status is in
[`quality_scale.yaml`](custom_components/solaredge_v2/quality_scale.yaml).
